    <p> Thrive addresses the 5 dimensions of patient-centred access to care outlined in a 2013 study for conceptualising access at the interface of health systems published in the International Journal for Health Equity.</p> 
    <p> Approachability. Availability. Affordability. Acceptability. Appropriateness. </p> 

    <p>"There is evidence for the effectiveness of community interventions for improving mental health and some social outcomes across social-ecological levels. </p>

    <p>"The systematic review included 32 studies, all of which demonstrated a moderate to high promising effect for community-based and recovery-oriented practices or programs </p>

    <p>"Of the 2.3 million Canadians who reported unmet or partially met mental healthcare needs, the most frequently reported barriers were related to personal circumstances (78.2%), such as not knowing where to get help, being too busy, or not being able to pay for services.</p>
