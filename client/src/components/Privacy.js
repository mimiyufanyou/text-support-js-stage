        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Thrive platform, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, or otherwise contact us.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        How We Use Your Information
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We use personal information collected via our platform for a variety of business purposes described below:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For operational purposes, such as account management or other non-marketing purposes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To facilitate account creation and the logon process. If you choose to link your account with us to a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate account creation and logon process for the performance of the contract.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To comply with legal requirements and obligations. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We only share and disclose your information in the following situations: 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Compliance with Laws. We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Vital Interests and Legal Rights. We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

        How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our platform is at your own risk. You should only access the platform within a secure environment.
